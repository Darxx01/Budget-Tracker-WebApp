## Documentation for timer/init.py

This file defines a `timer` function that is used to measure and log the execution time of another function, while also handling any exceptions that may occur during its execution.

**Functions:**

- `timer(func, *args, **kwargs)`
  - This function takes a callable function `func` as its first argument, along with zero or more positional arguments (`*args`) and zero or more keyword arguments (`**kwargs`) that will be passed to the function.
  - Executes the provided `func` function and measures its execution time.
  - Logs the start and end of execution, along with the total duration, at the debug level.
  - In case of unhandled exceptions raised within the `func` function, logs the exception message and stack trace at the critical level and then re-raises the exception.
  - Returns the return value of the executed `func` function.

**Internal Variables:**

- `__s`: This is a function-like (callable) object defined using a lambda expression. It is used to get the start time when the timer is started.
- `__e`: This is another function-like (callable) object defined using a lambda expression. It is used to get the end time when the timer is stopped.

**Example Usage:**

```python
from timer import timer

def my_function(a, b):
  # Simulate some work in progress
  time.sleep(1)
  return a + b

result = timer(my_function, 5, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

In this example, `timer` measures the execution time of `my_function` and logs the start, end, and duration of its execution. It then executes `my_function` with the arguments 5 and 3, and returns the result (which in this case is 8). If `my_function` raises an exception, `timer` would log the error and then re-raise the exception.

**Additional Notes:**

- The `timer` function uses the `logging` module to log messages to the console. The default logging level is `DEBUG`, which means that all messages will be logged to the console. You can change the logging level by modifying the `logging` configuration in your application.
- The `timer` function does not currently provide any way to stop the timer manually. If you need to stop the timer early, you can call the `time.time()` function yourself and then calculate the elapsed time manually.
